This code is developed as part of the SheCodesPlus workshop. The objective of the final project was to create a simple weather application with real data using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
I sketched the initial design with InVision, worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and Axios, fetched the weather data with OpenWeather API and hosted it with Netlify.
